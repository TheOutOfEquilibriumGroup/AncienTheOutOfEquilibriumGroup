We received the 2022-2023 Peter E. and Anna Giants Kennedy College of Sciences Endowed Fund for Advanced Research with Prof. Jerome Delhommelle and Prof. Hugo Ribeiro for our research project “Harnessing nonequilibrium phenomena in emergent quantum materials”. The funds will be used to provide research stipends to Emma and Jerison over the Spring and Summer.
